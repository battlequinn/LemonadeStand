# LemonadeStand
My first Lemonade Stand Game

*S.O.L.I.D.* Principles:

Single-Responsibility Principle: Headline.
	
	My headline class is a great example of the s.r.p. because it simply contains a member variable of 
	an array of strings to be chosen from and a method that selects one of those strings at random.

Open/Closed Principle: Recipe.

	A good example of the Open/Close Principle in my Lemonade Stand game is the recipe class. 
	It has all of it's fields private while using get/set accessors to allow for external extension, and 
	it has a public method which displays its contents when another method calls it.
